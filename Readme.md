# Wormhole Codes

Iterative Matlab code for solving Schwinger-Dyson equations in the SYK and low-rank SYK models.

## Description

In https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07770 we demonstrate that the ground spaces of the SYK and low-rank SYK models can be viewed as approximate quantum error-correcting codes. Like all quantum error-correcting codes, the quality of these codes is characterized by their rate and distance. We compute these quantities numerically by solving the large-N Schwinger-Dyson equations using an iterative algorithm. This Matlab code provides methods for solving these equations and computing the resulting Renyi entropies that appear in the paper.
